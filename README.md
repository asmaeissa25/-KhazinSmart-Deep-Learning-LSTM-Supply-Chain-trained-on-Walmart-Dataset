**KhazinSmart** is an enterprise-grade AI-powered inventory management solution tailored for the Moroccan retail and grocery sector. It bridges the gap between traditional logistics and modern predictive analytics.

---

## 🚀 The Vision
In Morocco, thousands of tons of perishable goods are wasted annually due to inefficient stock management and lack of demand forecasting. **KhazinSmart** leverages artificial intelligence to help business owners predict exactly what their customers need, when they need it, and where.

## ✨ Key Features
* **📈 AI Demand Forecasting:** High-accuracy sales trend predictions for major Moroccan hubs (Casablanca, Tangier, Marrakech, Agadir, etc.).
* **🚨 Smart Expiry Engine:** Automated real-time alerts for products nearing their expiration date to minimize loss.
* **🌍 Multi-City Regional Sync:** A centralized dashboard to manage and balance inventory across different regional warehouses.
* **📊 Inventory Insights:** Professional KPIs tracking stock turnover, waste prevention, and profit margins.
  
## 🧠 The AI Engine: LSTM Neural Networks
KhazinSmart isn't just a dashboard; it's powered by a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** recurrent neural network. 

* **Trained Data:** We used historical sales datasets specifically from the Moroccan retail market, including seasonal peaks (Ramadan, Eid, Summer holidays).
* **Time-Series Analysis:** The LSTM model analyzes past inventory flows to predict future demand with high precision.
* **Adaptability:** Unlike traditional algorithms, our model learns from local market fluctuations and supply chain disruptions.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React.js (Vite)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Modern SaaS Aesthetics)
* **Icons:** Lucide React
* **UI Architecture:** Modular Component-Based Design
