## ✨ Key Features
* **📈 Smart Forecasting:** Visual demand curves using AI to prevent overstocking.
* **📦 Inventory Control:** Real-time monitoring of stock value, turnover (e.g., **12.4x**), and waste avoided.
* **🌍 Multi-Hub Sync:** Centralized management for regional distribution centers.
* **🚨 Automated Alerts:** Low-stock and expiry notifications to protect margins.
